# Project---A-website-about-myself

This website has two parts.

Part 1: An ancient personal website about myself with a few HTML5 web pages with style sheets and JavaScript.

Part 2: A simple front-end (AJAX) application to fetch JSON array data from remote web service and render the array data in a web page with CSS cards.
